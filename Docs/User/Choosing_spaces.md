# Space selection

Under the 'Select Space' tab, you may choose to make maps of any accessible in-game space, instead of the usual Appalachia overworld.

## Choosing a space
You can select a space to map using the drop-down in the 'Select Space' tab.<br/>
Unless you have 'Search Settings > Search in all Spaces' selected, all search results are constrained to items within the selected space.<br/>
You can quick-swap to a different space by double clicking its name in the search results grid.

## Space-specific settings
Some settings are specific to certain spaces, and may be disabled depending on your selected space - they are;
* 'Background Image', 'Highlight Water', and 'Show Map Markers' options which are only available when 'Appalachia' is selected.
* 'Height Cropping' controls which are only available when 'Appalachia' is not selected.

## Background image
When changing the selected space, the map background will automatically change to a top-down rendered view of the location.

## Height distribution cropping (floor mapping)
In order to clearly map individual floors of an interior space, Mappalachia allows you to restrict which items are mapped by their height.<br/>
You can visualize the distribution by height of items in an interior by pressing the 'Visualize Height Distribution' button. This provides a crude graph of the distribution of items in the space, separated into height bands.<br/>
In a multi-floor interior you will typically be able to see distinct spikes at certain height bands.<br/>
Using the information from the height distribution, you can now adjust the minimum and maximum height percentages which you wish to map for.<br/>
Please note that this unfortunately does not affect the background image.

## Additional info
When the selected space is not an exterior world, Mappalachia adds some extra info to the map.<br/>
You will see the current space, selected height distribution and scale are provided.<br/>
The scale is auto-calculated by Mappalachia, and it represents the best fit possible while still containing everything within the cell. The ratio relates the size to other cell maps.
