# Miscellaneous and Advanced Searching/Plotting Features

### Filters
At the top of the window you can filter your search results by their category, or their lock type.<br/>
The categories are defined by Bethesda, and therefore sometimes unexpected, so it is typically best to use 'Select Recommended' category filters.

## Space Selection & Searching
Use the 'Selected Space' drop down to change the space for your map. By default search results are only for the selected space. You may select 'Search Settings > 'Search in all Spaces' to show results regardless of space. You can also double-click the space column of the search results to quick-swap to that space.<br/>

If you plot an item which is not in the currently selected space, it will typically not show up. However, if there is a door connecting the two spaces, then these items will be plotted at that doorway, indicating your search results exist in a connecting space.<br/>
Use 'Plot Settings' > 'Auto-find items in other spaces' to automatically find and plot your selected items, wherever they may exist in all connected spaces.<br/>

Additionally, you may filter your search results to only show spaces which are instances ('Search Settings' > 'Search in instances only').

## Show Instance FormIDs
An advanced option for data miners, selecting 'Plot Settings' > 'Show Instance FormID' will annotate the FormID of the plotted entities onto the map against their plot.<br/>
This only applies to Standard or Topographic plot mode.
