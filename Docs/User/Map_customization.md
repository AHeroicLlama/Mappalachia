# Map Customization options

Under the 'Map' menu, there are several options which allow you to change the appearance of the overall map;

## Title
This allows you to set a title for the map - it will show in the top-right, and will be the default filename when saving the map image.

## Font Sizes
Allows you to amend the sizes of all text which may appear on the map.

## Map Markers
You can independently toggle map marker Icons or Labels to appear against their respective locations on the map.<br/>
'Icons' shows the in-game map icons for named locations, whereas 'Labels' annotates their name onto the map.<br/>

## Background Image
Change the background image of the map.
- Normal: The standard in-game pause menu map.
- Military: The map from the nuke targeting computer.
- Satellite: A top-down render of the world.
- None: No background (Useful for further edits).

## Grayscale
This toggles the underlying map image to be in grayscale (black and white) or full color.

## Brightness
This option allows you to tweak the percentage brightness of the underlying map image. Enter any value from 10% to 200%.

## Highlight Water
This option will add a colored overlay which clearly highlights the surface of all bodies of water.

## Show Compass
This option controls when a compass rose should be displayed on the map. The default option, "When Useful" only draws when North is not 'up' in the current map. You may also select to always or never show it.

## Legend Style
This provides control over how (or if) the legend is drawn.
* Normal: The default mode, the legend is drawn up against the left hand side, inside the map image.
* Extended: The final image is expanded, drawing the legend fully outside of the original map image, ensuring none of the map can be obscured.
* Hidden: No legend is drawn.
