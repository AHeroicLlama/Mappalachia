# Your first Mappalachia map

### The Mappalachia interface
There are 4 key elements to the Mappalachia Window which you'll be presented with;
* The search control. This contains the standard search (among 2 other tabs), alongside optional search filters.
* The search results grid. This lists everything matching your search criteria above.
* The 'items to plot' grid. This lists everything you have selected to plot on your map.
* The map itself.

### Searching
With the 'Standard Search' tab selected - at the top of the page you will see the search field.<br/>
In this search field, try entering "caps stash" and press the 'Standard Search' button or hit enter.<br/>
You should now see the 'Search Results' list populate with matches to your search, which in this case should contain a result for "LPI_Loot_CapsStash_Tin" - this name is Bethesda's internal development name for caps stashes.<br/>

### Building the map
In the search results list, select the item you wish to map (or multiple by holding ctrl or shift), and select 'Add to Map'.<br/>
The selected items should now be listed in the 'Items to plot' list. You may conduct an additional search and add more items if you wish.<br/>
If you are happy with the items, press the 'Update Map' button (or select Map > Update Map). Mappalachia will then collect the coordinates for every instance of your selected items and plot them with icons on the map. When finished the map on the right hand side will update with your plots, and will display a legend on the left hand side of the image, along with the icons which they are represented by.<br/>

### Previewing and sharing the map
You can pan and zoom this map preview by left-clicking and dragging, or using the scroll wheel respectively (or equivalent touch gestures).<br/>
Double-clicking the map (or selecting Map > View) will open the preview in full in your default image viewer, which may provide an easier viewing experience.<br/>
In order to quickly export and share the map, use 'Map > Quick Save' (Ctrl+Shift+S).<br/>
For more control over export settings, use 'Map > Export To File...'<br/>

### Clear & Reset
At the bottom of the 'Map' menu you can select 'Clear' or 'Reset'.<br/>
* Clear will simply remove items from the legend and the map. It won't change any Map settings. This is ideal for making a new map.
* Reset will completely reset all map-related settings.
