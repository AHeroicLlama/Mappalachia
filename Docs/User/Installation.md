# Welcome to Mappalachia

## Installing Mappalachia
To install Mappalachia, you simply need download the latest release of `Mappalachia.zip`, which can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/AHeroicLlama/Mappalachia/releases/).<br/>
Once downloaded, unzip `Mappalachia.zip` to any folder.<br/>
Then, run `Mappalachia.exe`, which has a yellow 'M' icon.<br/>

## .NET Runtime
Mappalachia uses a technology from Microsoft called .NET. If you don't already have this installed, you will be prompted to install it first.<br/>
This is a necessary step to run Mappalachia.

## First run
When you first launch Mappalachia, Windows SmartScreen may warn you of a potential security risk. This is because Mappalachia has so few users that Microsoft hasn't collected enough data yet.<br>
You should select 'more info' then 'run anyway'.<br/>

## Installing Spotlight
Spotlight is a powerful optional feature which allows you to zoom in to satellite views at great detail.<br/>

Due to the large file sizes, spotlight is not included by default, but you can choose to download and install it by following these steps:<br/>
* If you have not already, [install 7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html). 7-Zip is a popular tool for creating and opening compressed files.
* Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/AHeroicLlama/Mappalachia/releases/latest) on GitHub.
* Under assets, download all files named `spotlight.7z.xxx` where xxx are numbers 001 and up.
* Once all files are downloaded, move them to your Mappalachia install location, into the folder `img\`.
* Right click the file `spotlight.7z.001`, and select `7-Zip` > `Extract Here`.
* 7-Zip will unpack all the spotlight images, creating the folder `spotlight\` inside of `img\`.
* Once 7-Zip has completed, you are ready to use the Spotlight feature.
* You may delete all the files you downloaded, leaving the new folder remaining.

## Updating
Mappalachia will automatically check for updates when it is launched.<br/>
If a new version is available, you will be given the option to download it. The process is the same as your first installation, but you should overwrite your current installation with the new one.

### Updating spotlight
If you already have the latest version of spotlight installed, you may quickly download only newly updated parts of it for the current patch by downloading `Patch_Spotlight.zip` from the latest release, and unzipping it into the `img\` folder, merging with the `spotlight\` folder you already have there.<br/>
This zip will always only contain spotlight data which changed between this release and the prior.
