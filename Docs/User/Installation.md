# Welcome to Mappalachia

## Installing Mappalachia
To install Mappalachia, you simply need download the latest release of `Mappalachia.zip`, which can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/AHeroicLlama/Mappalachia/releases/).<br/>
Once downloaded, unzip `Mappalachia.zip` to any folder.<br/>
Then, run `Mappalachia.exe`, which has a yellow 'M' icon.<br/>

## .NET Runtime
Mappalachia uses a technology from Microsoft called .NET. If you don't already have this installed, you will be prompted to install it first.<br/>
This is a necessary step to run Mappalachia.

## First run
When you first launch Mappalachia, Windows SmartScreen may warn you of a potential security risk. This is because Mappalachia has so few users that Microsoft hasn't collected enough data yet.<br>
You should select 'more info' then 'run anyway'.<br/>

## Updating
Mappalachia will automatically check for updates when it is launched.<br/>
If a new version is available, you will be given the option to download it. The process is the same as your first installation, but you should overwrite your current installation with the new one.
