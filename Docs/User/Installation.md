# Welcome to Mappalachia

## Installing Mappalachia
To install Mappalachia, you simply need download the latest release of `Mappalachia.zip`, which can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/AHeroicLlama/Mappalachia/releases/).<br/>
Once downloaded, unzip `Mappalachia.zip` to any folder.<br/>
Then, run `Mappalachia.exe`, which has a yellow 'M' icon.<br/>

## .NET Runtime
Mappalachia uses a technology from Microsoft called .NET. If you don't already have this installed, you will be prompted to install it first.<br/>
This is a necessary step to run Mappalachia.

## First run
When you first launch Mappalachia, Windows SmartScreen may warn you of a potential security risk. This is because Mappalachia has so few users that Microsoft hasn't collected enough data yet.<br>
You just need to select 'more info' then 'run anyway'.<br/>

## Installing Spotlight
Spotlight is a powerful optional feature which allows you to zoom in to satellite views at great detail. (See [Advanced Plotting](Advanced_plotting.md) for more details on using it once installed.)<br/>

Due to the large file sizes, spotlight is not included by default, but you can choose to download and install by following these steps:<br/>
* If you have not already, [install 7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html). 7-Zip is a popular tool for creating and opening compressed files.
* Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/AHeroicLlama/Mappalachia/releases/latest) on GitHub.
* Under assets, download all files named `spotlight.7z.xxx` where xxx are numbers 001 and up.
* Once all files are downloaded, move them to your Mappalachia install location, into the folder `img\`.
* Right click the file `spotlight.7z.001`, and select `7-Zip` > `Extract Here`.
* 7-Zip will unpack all the spotlight images, creating the folder `spotlight\` inside of `img\`.
* Once 7-Zip has completed, you may delete all the files you downloaded, and you are ready to use the Spotlight feature.
