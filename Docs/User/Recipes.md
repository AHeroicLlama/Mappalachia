# Recipes
Recipes provide a way to save and load your configured map plots and settings.<br/>
You can save or load a recipe at 'Map' > 'Save as recipe' or 'Load recipe'.<br/>

Recipe files store the 'Items to plot', all Map Settings, and all Plot Settings.

Note that upon loading a recipe, Mappalachia will not save your user settings until restarted.<br/>

Recipe files are saved as JSON, and may be further edited in a text editor at your own risk.<br/>
Technical users may pass recipe files as arguments to the `Mappalachia.exe`, which automatically outputs the rendered map image file(s).
