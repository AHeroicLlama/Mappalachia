# Welcome to Mappalachia

## Installing Mappalachia
To install Mappalachia, you simply need download the latest release of `Mappalachia.zip`, which can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/AHeroicLlama/Mappalachia/releases/).<br/>
Once downloaded, make a new folder anywhere you like, and unzip all the contents to that folder.<br/>
Once unzipped, run `Mappalachia.exe`, which has a yellow 'M' icon.

## First run
It is possible due to Mappalachia being brand new and infrequently used, that certain antivirus software may block Mappalachia simply because it has not seen it before, and you may need to choose to allow Mappalachia to run. As always on the internet you should use your best judgement when running new software, however I would remind any users with doubts that Mappalachia is fully open-source and anyone is welcome and encouraged to validate my claim that Mappalachia is genuine.<br/>
Developers are also free to compile Mappalachia themselves from source code, should you wish. Guides are available under `\Guides_dev`.

## Uninstalling Mappalachia
Since Mappalachia is effectively a standalone application, it doesn't need uninstalling. You may simply delete the folder which you extracted Mappalachia to, and it will be gone without a trace.<br/>

## Updating Mappalachia
To update Mappalachia you simply need to repeat exactly the same steps as you did to install. Make sure to *overwrite* the files when you unzip the newer version. If you like, you may delete the old version first.<br/>
You can check the release page at any time by selecting Help > Check for Updates.<br/>
