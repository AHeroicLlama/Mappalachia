# Map Settings

There are two key settings which can be adjusted on the Mappalachia Map to aid visibility, plus background options and some reset options;

## Brightness
By navigating to Map > Adjust Brightness, you can tweak the percentage brightness of the underlying map image. Enter any value from 5% to 300%.

## Grayscale
By navigating to Map > Grayscale, you can toggle the underlying map image to be in grayscale (black and white) or full color.

## Military Style
Under Map > Military Style you can toggle the underlying map image to be the version from the nuke targeting computer.

## Clear & Reset
At the bottom of the 'Map' menu you can select 'Clear' or 'Reset'.<br/>
* Clear will simply remove items from the legend and the map. It won't change any Map settings. This is ideal for making a new map.
* Reset will completely reset all map-related settings, including all of those listed above. It will also remove items from the legend and will reset the pan/zoom of the map.

## Cell Mode
Cell mode is an advanced option which provides a way to plot items in internal cells. [Cell mode has its own documentation here](Cell_mode.md).
