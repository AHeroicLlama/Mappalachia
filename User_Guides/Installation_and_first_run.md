# Welcome to Mappalachia

## Installing Mappalachia
To install Mappalachia, you simply need download the latest release of `Mappalachia.zip`, which can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/AHeroicLlama/Mappalachia/releases/).<br/>
Once downloaded, make a new folder anywhere you like, and unzip all the contents to that folder.<br/>
Once unzipped, run `Mappalachia.exe`, which has a yellow 'M' icon.

## First run
When you first launch Mappalachia, it is possible that systems such as Windows SmartScreen will warn you of a potential security risk. However, this is simply Windows being cautious because Mappalachia doesn't have very many users, and you will just need to select 'more info' then 'run anyway'.<br/>
