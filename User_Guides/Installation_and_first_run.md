# Welcome to Mappalachia

## Installing Mappalachia
To install Mappalachia, you simply need download the latest release of `Mappalachia.zip`, which can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/AHeroicLlama/Mappalachia/releases/).<br/>
Once downloaded, make a new folder anywhere you like, and unzip all the contents to that folder.<br/>
Once unzipped, run `Mappalachia.exe`, which has a yellow 'M' icon.

## First run
When you first launch Mappalachia, it is possible that systems such as Windows SmartScreen will warn you of a potential security risk. However, this is simply Windows being cautious because Mappalachia doesn't have very many users, and you will just need to select 'more info' then 'run anyway'.<br/>

You may also be prompted by Windows to install the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8 Runtime if you don't already have it. Mappalachia requires this to run so you'll need to proceed with the installer.
If you're running an up-to-date and modern Windows installation, you probably already have this installed.
