# Welcome to Mappalachia

## Installing Mappalachia
To install Mappalachia, you simply need download the latest release of `Mappalachia.zip`, which can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/AHeroicLlama/Mappalachia/releases/).<br/>
Once downloaded, make a new folder anywhere you like, and unzip all the contents to that folder.<br/>
Once unzipped, run `Mappalachia.exe`, which has a yellow 'M' icon.

## First run
It is possible due to the small user base of Mappalachia, that certain antivirus software may block Mappalachia since they have not gathered enough info on it yet. They do this as a precaution, and not because there is any risk in running Mappalachia. As a result, you may need to take action to allow Mappalachia to run.<br/>
As always on the internet you should use your best judgement when running new software, however I would remind any users with doubts that Mappalachia is fully open-source and anyone is welcome and encouraged to validate my claim that Mappalachia is genuine.<br/>

You may also be prompted by Windows to install the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8 Runtime if you don't already have it. Mappalachia requires this to run so you'll need to proceed with the installer.
If you're running an up-to-date and modern Windows installation, you probably already have this installed.
