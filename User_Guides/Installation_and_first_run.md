# Welcome to Commonwealth Cartography

## Installing Commonwealth Cartography
To install Commonwealth Cartography, you simply need download the latest release of `CommonwealthCartography.zip`, which can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/Mappalachia/Commonwealth_Cartography/releases/).<br/>
Once downloaded, make a new folder anywhere you like, and unzip all the contents to that folder.<br/>
Once unzipped, run `CommonwealthCartography.exe`, which has a yellow 'C' icon.

## First run
When you first launch Commonwealth Cartography, it is possible that systems such as Windows SmartScreen will warn you of a potential security risk. However, this is simply Windows being cautious because Commonwealth Cartography doesn't have very many users, and you will just need to select 'more info' then 'run anyway'.<br/>
