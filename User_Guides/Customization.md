# Map Settings

There are two key settings which can be adjusted on the Mappalachia Map to aid visibility, plus background options and some reset options;

## Brightness
By navigating to Map > Adjust Brightness, you can tweak the percentage brightness of the underlying map image. Enter any value from 5% to 300%.

## Grayscale
By navigating to Map > Grayscale, you can toggle the underlying map image to be in grayscale (black and white) or full color.

## Military Style
Under Map > Military Style you can toggle the underlying map image to be the version from the nuke targeting computer.

## Clear & Reset
At the bottom of the 'Map' menu you can select 'Clear' or 'Reset'.<br/>
* Clear will simply remove items from the legend and the map. It won't change any Map settings. This is ideal for making a new map.
* Reset will completely reset all map-related settings, including all of those listed above. It will also remove items from the legend and will reset the pan/zoom of the map.

### Plot Icon settings
By navigating to Plot Settings > Plot Icon Settings you can access full control over the visuals of the icons displayed on the map.<br/>
The first four settings control the size (total diameter) of the icons, their width (thickness of the lines which make them up), their opacity (or lack of transparency), and finally the darkness of the drop shadow under each icon.<br/>
Plot Icon settings apply to both Icon and Topography mode, however Topography mode overrides colors.

### Colors and shapes
At the bottom of the form are two collections or 'Palettes' - of colors and shapes.<br/>
These palettes are used to determine the available combinations of shapes and colours that will be used to generate icons to plot items on the map. Inherently, by adding new shapes and colors you create a greater number of possible icons for Mappalachia to use, and by removing them you reduce the available icons.<br/>
On the left hand side is the color Palette. You may add or remove colors to the palette, or select a premade palette using the drop-down. You can bulk-remove colors by selecting multiple before pressing remove.<br/>
On the right hand side is the shape palette. You can cycle through the settings for each shape by selecting each shape in the list view. Adjust the settings of each shape by toggling the shape checkboxes while it is selected. If you add a new shape it will be created with random settings, which you can later edit. You may also remove the selected shape by pressing 'Remove Selected'.<br/>
You can reset all Plot Icon Settings by pressing Reset to Default in the bottom left.
