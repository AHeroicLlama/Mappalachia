# Your first Mappalachia map

### The Mappalachia interface
There are 4 key elements to the Mappalachia Window which you'll be presented with;
* The search area. This contains the standard search (which we'll stick to for now), alongside optional search filters.
* The search results grid. This lists everything matching your search criteria above.
* The 'legend' or 'items to plot' grid. This lists everything you have selected to plot on your map.
* The map itself.

### Searching
With the 'Standard Search' tab selected - at the top of the page you will see the search field.<br/>
In this search field, try entering "caps stash" and press the 'Standard Search' button or hit enter.<br/>
You should now see the 'Search Results' list populate with matches to your search, which in this case should contain a result for "LPI_Loot_CapsStash_Tin" - this name is Bethesda's internal development name for caps stashes.<br/>

### Building the map
In the search results list, select the item you wish to map (or multiple by holding ctrl or shift), and select 'Add to Map'.<br/>
The selected items should now be listed in the 'Items to plot' list. You may conduct an additional search and add more items if you wish.<br/>
If you are happy with the items, press the 'Update Map' button. Mappalachia will then collect the coordinates for every instance of your selected items and plot them with icons on the map. When finished the map on the right hand side will update with your plots, and will display a legend on the left hand side of the image, along with the icons which they are represented by.<br/>
Please note that mapping too many items can cause some items on the legend to not fit on the map image.<br/>

### Previewing and sharing the map
You can pan and zoom this map preview by left-clicking and dragging, or using the scroll wheel respectively (or equivalent touch gestures).<br/>
Double-clicking the map (or selecting Map > View) will open the preview in full in your default image viewer, which may provide an easier viewing experience.<br/>
In order to export and share the map, navigate to Map > Export to File. Then simply provide a location and file name.<br/>
The images are lightly compressed to main good quality while keeping the file size low enough to easily share online.
