# Cell mode

Cell mode provides a way to plot items in internal cells.

## Activating Cell Mode
You can toggle Cell mode on or off by navigating to Map > Cell mode.<br/>
Once on, you will notice a new panel of controls for Cell mode has appeared on the 'Standard Search' tab. Also, that the Appalachian map background has disappeared.<br/>
(Unfortunately, Bethesda do not provide maps for interiors of Fallout 76, so Mappalachia must start with a transparent background.)<br/>
A few settings are also disabled while in Cell mode as they are not applicable, these are brightness and grayscale settings, optional map backgrounds, and NPC/Scrap Search.

## Choosing a cell
While in cell mode, all searches and plots are constrained specifically to the contents of the currently selected cell.<br/>
You can change to a new cell at any time using the drop down, but doing so will clear your search results and plots for the current cell.

## Drawing a background
To substitute the lack of internal maps, Mappalachia offers an alternative by drawing an 'outline' or silhouette of all items in the currently selected cell as the background. This is on by default can be toggled on/off using the 'Draw Outline' check box.

## Height distribution cropping (floor mapping)
In order to clearly map individual floors of a cell, Mappalachia allows you to restrict which items are mapped by their height.<br/>
You can visualize the distribution by height of items in a cell by pressing the 'Visualize Height Distribution' button. This provides a crude text graph of the distribution of items in a cell, separated into height bands.<br/>
In a multi-floor cell you will typically be able to see distinct spikes at certain height bands.<br/>
Using the information from the height distribution, you can now adjust the minimum and maximum height percentages which you wish to map for. This will also adjust the outline if it is enabled.

## Additional info
Cell mode also adds additional info on the bottom right of the map image. You will see the current cell, selected height distribution and scale are provided.<br/>
The scale is auto-calculated by Mappalachia, and it represents the best fit possible while still containing everything within the cell. The ratio relates to the size versus the normal Appalachia map.
