# Updating or Uninstalling

## Checking for updates
As of version 1.2.0.0, Mappalachia will automatically check for updates every time you launch it. If it finds an available update, it will prompt you to download [the latest release on GitHub](https://github.com/AHeroicLlama/Mappalachia/releases/latest).<br/>
You can also check at any time by selecting Help > Check for Updates.<br/>

If you are using an older version of Mappalachia, you will need to manually visit [this](https://github.com/AHeroicLlama/Mappalachia/releases) page to check for updates yourself.<br/>

Your current Mappalachia version is listed under Help > About.

### Installing updates
If you want to update to a newer version, you simply need to downalod and then unzip the new release into the folder containing your current installation, making sure to overwrite all files. You will also need to close Mappalachia before overwriting.

## Uninstalling Mappalachia
Mappalachia doesn't need uninstalling - you may simply delete the folder which you extracted Mappalachia to, and it will be gone without a trace.<br/>
